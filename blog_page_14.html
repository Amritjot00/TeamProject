            <p>In our digitally driven life, technology is reshaping the world of fashion. We have it all from artificial intelligence algorithms that forecast styles and trends, virtual reality rooms that act as mirrors of your dressing room, robots that tailor-make your clothes to fashionable accessories that maintain your body temperature, check your heartbeat and relax your muscles, innovative methods that reduce fabric wastage and burden on resources. In fact, fashion has always been at the centre of innovation—from the invention of the sewing machine to the rise of e-commerce. Like tech, fashion is forward-looking and cyclical.
                <br><br>
                According to CB Insights’ Industry Analyst Consensus, the fashion industry is one of the largest industries in the world, with an estimated worth of more than $3T by the end of the decade.
                <br><br>
                Today, fashion technology is growing at a lightning pace, undergoing massive transformations from design to manufacturing to production and distribution. Google is leading the clout as it tested user-driven AI fashion design with Project Muze, an experiment deployed in partnership with Zalandon, a Germany based fashion platform in the year 2016. Project Muze made use of an algorithm to create designs based on users’ interests and aligned them with the style preferences recognised by the network. Similarly, Amazon’s project was spearheaded by Israel-based researchers where machine learning was used to assess whether an item is “stylish” or not. Another one out of Amazon’s Lab126 R&D arm in California employs images to understand a specific fashion style and then create similar images from scratch. Taking this concept of fast fashion forward, Amazon patented a manufacturing system to enable on-demand apparel-making in 2017. Algorithmic Couture is an innovative AI-driven design project which creates customised clothing from Tokyo-based design consultancy firm Synflux.
